# SentimentScope: Rating Analyzer

## 📌 Project Overview  
**SentimentScope: Rating Analyzer** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the sentiment of user reviews. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a deep learning model, the application classifies reviews into one of five categories:
- **1 - Very Bad Review** 😡  
- **2 - Bad Review** 😠  
- **3 - Average Review** 😐  
- **4 - Good Review** 😊  
- **5 - Excellent Review** 🌟  

The project leverages a robust dataset of 15,000+ reviews and provides an intuitive, interactive interface for predicting sentiments.
